## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document created for the first exercise (Pipeline) for the first formative assessment for MY472.

First function:

```{r filter circumference function}
# Install all packages
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```
```{r orange}
# Define a function that takes a dataset and filters out any orange trees 
# with a circumference less than 100
filter_circumference <- function(data) {
  data %>%
    filter(circumference >= 100)
}

```

```{r filter orange}
# Apply the previous function onto the Orange dataset
filtered_orange_trees <- filter_circumference(Orange)
filtered_orange_trees
```

Second function:
```{r rank age function}
# Define a function that sort the filtered dataframe by age and disaply them 
# from the oldest to the youngest
sort_by_age <- function(data_new){
  data_new %>%
    arrange(desc(age)) 
}

sort_by_age
```

```{r rank orange tree's age}
# Apply the age filtering functions onto the previously filtered dataframes
filtered_orange_trees <- sort_by_age(filtered_orange_trees)

# Use head() to verify the result
head(filtered_orange_trees)x
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
