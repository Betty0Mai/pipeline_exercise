## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document created for the first exercise (Pipeline) for the first formative assessment for MY472.

```{r}
# Install all packages
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r orange}
# Define a function that takes a dataset and filters out any orange trees 
# with a circumference less than 100
filter_circumference <- function(data) {
  data %>%
    filter(circumference >= 100)
}

```

```{r filter orange}
# Apply the previous function onto the Orange dataset
filtered_orange_trees <- filter_circumference(Orange)
filtered_orange_trees
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
